# Putting It All Together
## 3/12 Lab Report 5
### Part I
#### Debugging Scenario



### Part II
#### Reflection
Building my own grading script taught me the basic ideas behind Autograder, which is used heavily in my CS courses. Now that I know a bit more about how it works, I understand 
why the guidelines for PAs in the other CSE courses are so detailed and strict -- it's because Autograder checks for very specific things, such as specific files and method 
headers. That's why we can't change method headers and are asked to only submit the required files and not general directories. I also learned a lot more about `bash` script and the 
command line. `bash` syntax can be pretty annoying and confusing sometimes, but I appreciated how much it helped streamline certain processes. I especially enjoyed learning how to 
search files and edit files from terminal with `vim`. Finally, I learned that `jdb` existed, and some commands related to that to use this tool for debugging. I'd definitely like 
to practice with this framework a bit more because it's one of the skills I'm lest comfortable out of everything we covered this quarter.
