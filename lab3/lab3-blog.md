## 2/13 Lab Report 3

### Part 1: Bugs
Last week, I stepped through the process of indentifying and isolating progam bugs.  
<br/>For the `ArrayExamples` class, I used `JUnit` tests to check for buggy methods. Let's look at one example.
> ðŸ”„ **Buggy Method:** `reverseInPlace(int[] arr)`
> Failure-Inducing Input
> ```
> int[] fails = {3,2,1};
> assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1,2,3}, ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(fails));
> ```
> 
> Asymptomatic Input
> ```
> int[] passes = {3,3,3};
> assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,3,3}, input1);
> ```
> 
> Symptom
> ![Image](screenshots/bug-symptom.png)
> From the output after running my tests, it appears that the _failure-inducing input_ is not reversing as expected.
> 
> The Bug
> - Before fix:
>   ```
>   // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
>   static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
>       for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
>           arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
>       }
>   }
>   ```
>   The current issue is that the original value at each position is updated without being retained, so when we reach the later half of the list, the values arenâ€™t being changed
> - After fix:
>   ```
>   // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
>   static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
>       int replaced;
>       for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
>           replaced = arr[i];
>           arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
>           arr[arr.length - i - 1] = replaced;
>       }
>   }
>   ```
>   To fix the bug, I created a new variable called `replaced` to store the value being replaced, so itâ€™s not being overwritten. Then I only need to iterate through half of the list so the elements in the latter half of the list are updated with the value stored in the `replaced`.
